Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind-hearted woman named Maria. She lived alone and spent her days taking care of her garden and helping the villagers in need. One day, while on a walk in the forest, she stumbled upon a small bird with a broken wing. Without hesitation, she took the bird home and nursed it back to health. As a reward for her kindness, the bird transformed into a magical prince and granted Maria three wishes. She wished for an endless supply of food for the village, a beautiful garden for everyone to enjoy, and for the prince to be her friend forever. The prince granted her wishes and from that day forward, the village flourished and Maria lived happily ever after with her new friend. The end.
